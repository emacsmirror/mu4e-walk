#+AUTHOR: Timm Lichte

Move email addresses around when composing emails with [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

This README uses [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].

** Features

With just one key stroke:
- Move email address "vertically" between address fields (identified with =message-email-recipient-header-regexp=)
- Move email address "horizontally" within an address field
- Also works with regions

** Installation

*** Dependencies

-  [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] (mainly because it hooks into =mu4e-compose-mode=)

*** Installation with Melpa

Not yet available.

*** Installation from Github

Download =mu4e-walk.el= to your =.emacs.d= folder and add the following code to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package mu4e-walk
  :after mu4e
  :load-path "relative/path/to/mu4e-walk.el")
	:config
	(add-hook 'mu4e-compose-mode-hook 'mu4e-walk-add-keybindings-compose-mode) ; Optional
)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

The most important functions and keybindings are: 

| Function        | Keybinding  |
|-----------------+-------------|
| =mu4e-walk-up=    | =M-<up>=      |
| =mu4e-walk-down=  | =M-<down>=    |
| =mu4e-walk-left=  | =M-<left>=    |
| =mu4e-walk-right= | =M-<right>= |

** Configuration

For customizing the keybindings, take a look at the function =mu4e-walk-add-keybindings-compose-mode=. 

** Ideas & plans

As for my own needs, mu4e-walk is currently feature-complete.  

** Alternative and related Emacs packages

As far as I know, there are no similar packages.
